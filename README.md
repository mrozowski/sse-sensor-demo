# sse-sensor-demo
Demo of SSE (Server Sent Events) with Java and React. It's an example of collecting data from temperature and humidity sensors and pushing it to the frontend using SSE technology.
The frontend dynamically updates the displayed temperature and humidity values. Also, it uses Chart JS to display those values on a chart.
